How to : Add Download Link
1. Upload new file as a PDF to pdfs/
2. In server.js, add the following line along with the rest of the lines
   starting with app.get:
   app.get('/pdfs/<new-file-name>',
   (req, res) => res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '/pdfs/<new-file-name>')));
   where <new-file-name> is the name of the file for which you are creating a
   link.
3. In the file for the page where you want the link to be, add the following
   line:
   <a href="pdfs/<new-file-name>.pdf" download><description-of-document></a>
   where <description-of-document> is the clickable text to download the link.
4. Redeploy. Unfortunately, although you can download the datasheet in
   development mode, the PDF file becomes corrupted and cannot be open. You
   have to fully test this in deployment mode.
