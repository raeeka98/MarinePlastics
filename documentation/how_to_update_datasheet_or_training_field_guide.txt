How to : Update Datasheet
1. Upload new datasheet file as a PDF to pdfs/
2. In server.js, replace both instances of the previous datasheet path with the
   new datasheet path. 
3. In client/src/Protocol/Protocol.js, replace the previous datasheet path with
   the new datasheet path.
4. Redeploy. Unfortunately, although you can download the datasheet in
   development mode, the PDF file becomes corrupted and cannot be open. You
   have to fully test this in deployment mode.

Note: updating training field guide is almost identical to the above
instructions.
