This lists the changes made to the survey format after updating the survey to
match the 2020 data sheet.

1. Users can now enter numerical figures and punctuation in text fields. Did
   this by making changes to server_modules/joi-validation.js.
2. Now when uncheck the other option for the checkbox options, the other
   information doesn't get sent to the database. Did this by adding
   removeOther(category) in client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx and calling
   this method whenever the checkbox option other is unchecked in each checkbox
   section.
3. Added units after numerical data to the Review page in
   client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/Review.jsx.
4. Changed wind direction info in Review page by adding and calling
   calculateWindDirection(direction) in
   client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/Review.jsx.
