This lists the changes made to fix the location, survey, and survey edit pages.

1. Edited sumTotals(surveys, type) in client/src/_helpers/ChartHelpers.js to be
   able to calculate total micro debris.
2. Edited all methods in client/src/Location/Charts.jsx and added new method
   showBarData() to show a bar chart for micro debris data.
3. Edited all methods in client/src/SurveyEntry/SurveyCharts.jsx and added new
   method showBarData() to show a bar chart for micro debris data.
4. Added information on micro debris to display on survey page by modifying
   render() in client/src/SurveyEntry/SurveyEntry.jsx.
5. Added information on micro debris to display but not yet edit on survey edit
   page by modifying constructor(props), save(), and render().
6. Added allDebrisInfo, allDebrisInfoID, allDebrisNames,
   getAllDebrisNameById(), getAllDebrisID(debrisName), and getAllDebrisMap() to
   client/src/NewSurveyForm/debrisInfo.js, and import getAllDebrisMap into
   client/src/SurveyEntry/SurveyEntry.jsx and
   client/src/SurveyEntry/surveyEntryEdit.jsx to display categories of debris
   for old surveys that have been renamed.
7. Added editMDSData() in client/src/SurveyEntry/surveyEntryEdit.jsx for
   editing micro debris.
8. Edited surveys.update in server_modules/mongoose.js so converts fresh and
   weathered values for debris from string to decimal if needed, so the total
   trash stored in the collection yeartotals is not a bunch of numbers
   concatenated, but rather added arithmetically.
9. Added check in getStats() in client/src/Location/Location.jsx to not include
   micro debris as part of pie chart on location page.
