This lists further changes to the website after the changes made that are
listed in the fixes_to_view_and_edit_survey.txt.

Changed all instances on website of Sign Up to Sign Up/Login
1. Changed Sign Up button on landing page to the Sign Up/Login button by
   modifying LandingPage(props) in client/src/Landing/Landing.js.
2. Changed Sign Up link in header to Sign Up/Login by modifying Menu.render()
   in client/src/Header/Header.jsx.
   
Fixed bug where editing survey data won't update beach stats correctly
1. Added findDiffsDebris(oldDebris, newDebris, diffs) to
   server_modules/mongoose.js
2. Call findDiffsDebris(oldDebris, newDebris, diffs) in surveys.update instead
   of doing the calculations for updating the total types of debris in the
   method itself
3. Modified compareTrash(diffs, prevDebrisData, result) to reflect change of
   calling findDiffsDebris(oldDebris, newDebris, diffs)
