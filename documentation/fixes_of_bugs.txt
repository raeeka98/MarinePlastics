This lists further changes to the website after the changes made that are
listed in the fixes_to_view_and_edit_survey.txt.

Changed all instances on website of Sign Up to Sign Up/Login
1. Changed Sign Up button on landing page to the Sign Up/Login button by
   modifying LandingPage(props) in client/src/Landing/Landing.js
2. Changed Sign Up link in header to Sign Up/Login by modifying Menu.render()
   in client/src/Header/Header.jsx.
   
Fixed bug where editing survey data won't update beach stats correctly
1. Added findDiffsDebris(oldDebris, newDebris, diffs) to
   server_modules/mongoose.js
2. Called findDiffsDebris(oldDebris, newDebris, diffs) in surveys.update
   instead of doing the calculations for updating the total types of debris in
   the method itself
3. Modified compareTrash(diffs, prevDebrisData, result) to reflect change of
   calling findDiffsDebris(oldDebris, newDebris, diffs)

Fixed bugs with checkboxes for editing surveys
1. Added missing options for the major use and substrate type sections in the
   render() methods for client/src/SurveyEntry/SurveyEntry.jsx and
   client/src/SurveyEntry/surveyEntryEdit.jsx
2. Corrected  editSurveyCheckBoxes(e) in
   client/src/SurveyEntry/surveyEntryEdit.jsx so it modifies checkbox answers
   correctly
3. Added and called getCheckBoxData(category) in
   client/src/SurveyEntry/surveyEntryEdit.jsx so multiple checkbox answers that
   were checked may be visible
4. Modified render() in client/src/SurveyEntry/surveyEntryEdit.jsx so that the
   textboxes for the "other" options in the checkbox sections are only visible
   when the "other" checkbox is checked
5. Added removeOther(category) in client/src/SurveyEntry/surveyEntryEdit.jsx so
   the user can remove an "other" option by unchecking the option instead of
   deleting the text
6. Added functionality in render() in
   client/src/SurveyEntry/surveyEntryEdit.jsx so that the "other" textbox for a
   checkbox section shows if the survey originally had "other" checked
7. Added incomplete survey section for the survey page by modifying render() in
   client/src/SurveyEntry/SurveyEntry.jsx.
8. Added functionality in render() in
   client/src/SurveyEntry/surveyEntryEdit.jsx to allow users to edit the
   incomplete survey section of their surveys.

Fixed bug where couldn't submit a survey if the user clicks the "Add Survey"
link on the location page to add a survey
1. Moved updateLatLonFront(lat, lon) from
   client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/SurveyArea.jsx to
   client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx.
2. Modified componentDidMount() so if a beachID is passed via props, add the
   beach data to the survey data.

Fixed bug where couldn't go directly to view survey on survey page after adding
a survey. Before, users had to first navigate back to the home page, but now
the user gets a choice on whether to navigate to the home page or to the page
for the new survey.
1. Added getBeachData() to client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx
2. Used getBeachData() in showSubmitPage() in
   client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx to generate links to home page and
   the survey page for the new survey

Allow admins only to delete beaches
1. Modified DELETE function for /beaches/:beachID route in routes/dataEntry.js
   so only admins can delete beaches
2. Pass auth in props to Location in client/src/App.jsx
3. Added button on location page to delete beach if user is an admin by adding
   deleteBeach() and deleteBtn() and by modifying render() in
   client/src/Location/Location.jsx

Made headers of tables for Surface Rib Scan and Accumulation Survey on Add
Survey page stick to the top
1. Created client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/SurveySubsections.css
2. Used this stylesheet in render() in
   client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/SurfaceRibScan.jsx and render()
   in client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/AccumulationSurvey.jsx

4/19/21
Added Major Usage, Reason for Location Choice, and Compass Direction sections
to be autofilled
1. Moved majorUse, reason, and cmpsDir from surveySchema to beachSchema in
   server_modules/mongooseSchemas.js
2. Updated surveyDataSchema and beachDataSchema in
   server_modules/joi-validation.js to reflect the changes made in the previous
   step
3. Added majorUse, reason, and cmpsDir in beaches.getInfo(beachID) in
   server_modules/mongoose.js as values to return
4. Changed updateCoordStates(coordInfo, riverName, riverDist) to
   updateBeachState(coordInfo, majorUse, reason, cmpsDir, riverName, riverDist)
   in client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx to also update state for usage,
   locChoice, and compassDirection
5. Modified autofill(beachID) in
   client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/SurveyArea.jsx to call
   updateBeachState(coordInfo, majorUse, reason, cmpsDir, riverName, riverDist)
   and to update showOtherUsage and showOtherReason
6. Modified prepareForm() in client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx to move
   majorUse, reason, and cmpsDir from survData to beachData
7. Modified getCheckBoxData(category) and render() in
   client/src/SurveyEntry/SurveyEntry.jsx so that majorUse, reason, and cmpsDir
   are retrieved from info and not surveyData
8. Commented out editing majorUse, reason, and cmpsDir in render() in
   client/src/SurveyEntry/surveyEntryEdit.jsx
9. Set checkboxes to use checked attribute, not defaultValue or value, in
   render() in client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/SurveyArea.jsx and
   client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/AccumulationSurvey.jsx
