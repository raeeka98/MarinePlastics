# Updates July 2021

## Fixed bug so other option text box persists
1. Removed state variables in
client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/SurveyArea.jsx &
client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/AccumulationSurvey.jsx
2. Added showOthers in state of SurveyForm in
client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx
3. Added updateShowOthers in client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx
4. Modified updateBeachState in client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx so if
autofilled info has other text for usage or reason, update showOthers state variable
5. Modified removeOther in client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx so it first
strips "showOther" from category
6. In showInputPage in client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveyForm.jsx, passed
showOthers & updateShowOthers to SurveyArea & passed showOthers
updateShowOthers, & surveyData in AccumulationSurvey
7. Using showOthers to control checkboxes for other options in
client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/SurveyArea.jsx &
client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/AccumulationSurvey.jsx
8. Using updateShowOthers as handler for when an other option is checked or
unchecked in client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/SurveyArea.jsx &
client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/AccumulationSurvey.jsx
9. Changed defaultChecked to checked in
client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/SurveyArea.jsx &
client/src/NewSurveyForm/SurveySubsections/AccumulationSurvey.jsx
